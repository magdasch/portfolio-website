                <h4>The user problem</h4>
                <p>Olive’s users need a way to integrate and maintain healthier habits in everyday life because they want to improve their work-life balance for better mental and physical health.</p>
              </div><!-- close first column -->
              <div><!-- open second column -->
                <p>The solution: We know this is true when we observe Olive users receiving support to integrate and maintain healthier habits by organizing themselves more efficiently with the comprehensive calendar feature and incorporating workouts and meditations into their daily routines.</p>

              <p>To be able to start working on my project, I first collected information besides the project requirements to get to know the current standards on the market. Second I talked to users to find out more about problems they have with existing offers.<p>
            </div>
            <div class="row"><!-- open row with (2) columns -->
              <h3>Understand the problem</h3>
              <p>The first question I asked myself was how can I make a meaningful contribution with my wellbeing portal to existing offers. To get answers, on the one hand, I conducted competitive analysis in the field of sports and meditation.</p>

                    <p>The market offers many apps that specialize in either physical health or meditation. Through a holistic approach, Olive can complement the existing offers.</p>

              <div class="row"><!-- open row with (2) columns -->
                <p>On the other hand, I analyzed habit-building apps to learn about their strategies to introduce healthier lifestyles. Most of them rely on immense notifications to keep their users on the ball.</p>

                  <p>Based on user interview findings, I decided to make a difference with Olive by offering support without being annoying and restrictive. The focus lies on assisting. Olive offers opportunities for personal development with the greatest possible room for flexibility.</p>

                <h3>Observe</h3>
                <p>Keep in mind for whom you are designing.Due to my user-centered mindset, I care a lot about solving the **real problems of the target group**.
                  That's why I conducted a survey in the first step followed by three user interviews. To do this, I have set myself three research goals, from which I derived features based on my findings.</p>
                  <div><!--open first column -->
                    <h4>Research Goals</h4>
                    <ol>

                      <li>Find out which are the difficulties to maintain meaningful habits. >>> Assist users properly</li>
                      <li>Explore people’s pain points with existing services. >>> Adapt my offer to fulfill expectations</li>

                        <li>Consciously spend time with sport compensations or social balance.</li>
                        <li>Resolutions are good, but realistically, life gets in the way more often than not. That's why planability with the greatest possible flexibility is required.</li>
                        <li>Frequent notifications and reminders in the form of push messages are annoying and are muted by the majority of research participants.</li>

                        <li>A planning tool for optimal time management that visualizes clusters instead of individual tasks to keep track of everything.</li>
                        <li>Monitoring over a longer period instead of daily control of habits via the calendar overview.</li>

                  <p>As the next step, I processed the insights of the research phase into user personas, to keep the target group’s struggles pictorially present throughout the project. In the following, you will get to know Reynalda the first of three personas.</p>

              <h2>Conceptualisation</h2>
                <div class="row"><!-- open row with (2) column -->
                  <p>The ideation process starts with defining Reynalda's goals for a well-being portal. From this, I derived features for Olive and analyzed Reynalda's user journey according to those.</p>
                  <div><!-- open first column -->
                    <h4>Key goals</h4>
                    <p>Reynalda wants to document her various activities and appointments, as well as treatments and mental health stats in a simple way. She needs to keep the overview time-efficient and the monitoring as simple as possible.</p>
                  </div><!-- close first column -->
                  <div><!-- open second column -->
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>A feature that allows users to store and log their health information and other activities and creates simple overviews.</p>
                  </div><!-- close second column -->
                </div><!-- close row with (2) columns -->
                <div>
                  <p>The approach of deriving features from the persona's mental model makes it feasible to ensure more intuitive operation. Which in turn translates into a more pleasant and convenient user experience.<p>
                  <h4>Reynalda's user journey is divided into three phases:</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Record additional data linked to calendar entries</li>
                    <li>Save additional data directly in the calendar</li>
                    <li>Generate overviews to simply overlook activities</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
            <div class="row"><!-- open row with (2) columns -->
              <h3>Ideate</h3>
                <p>According to Reynalda's user journeys, I created a user flow to build a meaningful information architecture for Olive that adds value.</p>
                  <div><!--open first column -->

                <div><!--open second column -->
                  <p>The flow starts with the Log-in and is successfully performed by generating an overview of one’s activities.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Based on the User Flows of each persona, I’ve built a first draft of the sitemap, which was checked via card sorting. To conduct the card sorting with 10 participants I used the online tool Optimal Sort:</p>
                 <ul>
                   <li>For the first round, I did an open round of card sorting with five participants from across Europe and the US, to receive starting points for suitable naming of features and categories.</li>
                   <li>The second round was carried out to verify the features’ names with predefined categories, in which five additional participants from Austria took part.</li>
                 </ul>
                <p>After that, I reworked the sitemap and placed some features in a different place.</p>

            </div>
                <div>
                  <h4>Decisions I made despite the test results</h4>
                  <p>I kept a common category for Pomodoro Timer and App Blocker called "Focus Time" and did not split the functions as suggested by participants. Moving App Blocker to "My Account" would have torn apart the familiar functions.
                    Likewise, I left the exercise settings directly with the exercises in the same feature and didn't put the settings in “My Account”. I believe it's more comfortable to adjust settings directly before starting exercising.</p>
                  <h4>Both decisions will be particularly reviewed in the upcoming user test.<h4>

        <h3>Prototype Test</h3>
        <p>As the next step, I conducted 6 usability tests, in person and remotely with my Low-Fi prototype in greyscale. All tests were recorded to facilitate later analysis and adaptations.
          By using Jacob Nielson's scale and the analyzing tool Rainbow spreadsheet, I focused for my first round of adaptions on serious problems in the bottom menu:</p>

        <div><!--open second column -->
          <ol>
            <li>Separated meditation exercises from “Activities” and assigned the lotus icon to the feature “Meditation”.</li>
            <li>As a result, the feature “Focus time” received a more appropriate icon: the clock.</li>
            <li>Added another link to go back to the feature’s main page.</li>
          </ol>
        </div><!--close second column -->
        <h3>Adaptions</h3>
        <h4>Refining the User Interface</h4>
        <p>Throughout the process, I made further adjustments based on Gestalt principles and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), exemplified here on the dashboard.</p>
        <div><!--open first column -->

            <li>Hierarchy. Since this is the first visit to the Dashboard, the Welcome Message is placed more prominent and in a bigger font size.</li>
            <li>Law of proximity. The search bar and the dashboard icons are both shortcuts to get to certain features quickly. Therefore, they are placed closer to each other and the distance to the bottom menu is increased.</li>
          </ul>
        </div><!--close second column -->

          </ul>
        </div><!--close second column -->
        <p>With the polished prototype, I conducted a second round of usability testing to get feedback from my mentor. I made appropriate adjustments and then tested the changes in a third round on three more participants, all potential users.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This was one of the first projects I’ve walked through in the shoes of a UX/UI Designer and UX Researcher.</p>
        <div><!--open infobox -->
          <h4>My most important lessons learned while working on this project</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Set up a design system early: If the brand/product you're working for doesn't have a design system yet, I would design one as soon as it comes to visualizing wireframes in Figma or another design program.
              👉 This saves multiple revision cycles concerning the UI. The time can be used for iterations on the journey itself.</li>
            <li>I’ve made the mistake of concentrating more on the competitors’ offers than on their journeys. As a result, I came across some more manageable solutions in later stages. The revisions then turned out to be correspondingly more time-consuming than they would have been in earlier stages. 👉 Take your time extensively researching competitors in terms of their UX/UI solutions.</li>
            <li>Collaboration is the key. I conducted a total of three rounds of usability testing, even though the specifications only allowed for one round in the schedule. The additional rounds provided me with further valuable insights and I was able to test the usefulness of the adjustments I had made. 👉 This way, I could ensure that my changes benefited a broader group of users.</li>
